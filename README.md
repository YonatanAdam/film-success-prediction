# Movie Success Analysis

## Project Description
Part of my School Computer Science final project.

This project explores the relationship between the genre, target audience, and length of Hollywood films and their success. The analysis aims to identify patterns and predictors of success using machine learning techniques.

## Research Question
Is there a relationship between the genre of the film, the target audience, the length of the film, and the success of Hollywood films?

## Dataset
The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies). It includes information on various Hollywood movies such as budget, gross earnings, genre, runtime, and more.
